Run the server in development mode.

This doesn't work yet because apistar.ASyncApp has a bug, which is supposed
to be fixed by https://github.com/encode/apistar/pull/501 -- which hasn't
been merged yet.

Until then, we have to run with uvicorn:

$ uvicorn dplaapi:app
"""

from dplaapi import app
import sys

print(__doc__, file=sys.stderr)
exit(1)

app.serve('127.0.0.1', 8000, debug=True)
